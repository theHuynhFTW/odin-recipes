        <h3>Steps for cooking</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. 
                    Drain, crumble and set aside; reserve bacon drippings in skillet. </li>
                    <br>
                <li>Add potatoes, onion and chicken to bacon drippings and cook for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. 
                    Pour in chicken broth; season with poultry seasoning, <div> and pepper. 
                    Stir in corn, and simmer all together for 15 minutes.</div></li>
                    <br>
                <li>Pour in half-and-half and bring to a boil; add crumbled bacon. In a medium bowl, combine biscuit mix with 
                    milk and mix well (dough should be thick). <div>Drop tablespoon sizes of dough into boiling mixture; reduce heat 
                    and simmer for 10 minutes uncovered, then another 10 minutes covered. </div>(Note: Do not stir while simmering, or 
                    dumplings will break apart). Serve hot. </li>
