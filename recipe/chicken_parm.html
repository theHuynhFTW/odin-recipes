        <h3 class="header three">Description</h3>
            <p class="text"> Chicken Parmesan is no doubt the most popular non-pasta dish in Italian-American style restaurants. And while 
                this delicious meal may seem fancy, it's actually<br> pretty easy to make at home. In fact, chicken Parmesan is 
                one of those meals that's often best made in your own kitchen. The main problem I have with most versions<br> of 
                Chicken Parmesan served in restaurants is that they drown the chicken in so much sauce and cheese that it ends 
                up being a big soggy clump of chicken and cheese.<br> But it doesn't have to be that way, not with this method.

        <h3 class="header three">Ingredients</h3>
            <ul class="text">
                <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>

                <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>

                <li>2 large eggs</li>

                <li>1 cup panko bread crumbs, or more as needed</li>

                <li>¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided</li>

                <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, or more if needed</li>

                <li>½ cup olive oil for frying, or as needed</li>

                <li>½ cup prepared tomato sauce</li>

                <li>¼ cup fresh mozzarella, cut into small cubes</li>

                <li>¼ cup chopped fresh basil</li>

                <li>½ cup grated provolone cheese</li>

                <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
            </ul>

        <h3 class="header three">Steps for cooking</h3>
            <ol class="text">
                <li>Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</li>
                    <br>
                <li>Place chicken breasts between two sheets of heavy plastic (resealable freezer bags work well) 
                    on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound chicken with the smooth<br> side of a meat mallet to a thickness 
                    of 1/2-inch. Season chicken thoroughly with salt and pepper.</li>
                    <br>
                <li>Beat eggs in a shallow bowl and set aside. </li>
                    <br>
                <li>Mix bread crumbs and 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese in a separate bowl, set aside.</li>
                    <br>
                <li>Place flour in a sifter or strainer; sprinkle over chicken breasts, evenly coating both sides.</li>
                    <br>
                <li>Dip a flour-coated chicken breast in beaten eggs. Transfer breast to the bread crumb mixture, pressing 
                    crumbs into both sides. Repeat for each breast. Let<br> chicken rest for 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
                    <br>
                <li>Heat 1/2 inch olive oil in a large skillet on medium-high heat until it begins to shimmer. Cook chicken 
                    in the hot oil until golden, about 2 minutes per side.<br> The chicken will finish cooking in the oven.</li>
                    <br>
                <li>Transfer chicken to a baking dish. Top each breast with 2 tablespoons tomato sauce. Layer each chicken 
                    breast with equal amounts of mozzarella cheese,<br> fresh basil, and provolone cheese. Sprinkle remaining 
                    Parmesan over top and drizzle each with 1/2 teaspoon olive oil.</li>
                    <br>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is browned and bubbly and chicken breasts are no longer pink in 
                    the center, 15 to 20 minutes. An instant-read<br> thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 
                    165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
