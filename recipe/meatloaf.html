                <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>

                <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>

                <li>1 teaspoon dried Italian herbs</li>

                <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>

                <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>

                <li>½ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>

                <li>1 cup plain bread crumbs</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Ingredients for Glaze</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>

                <li>2 tablespoons ketchup</li>

                <li>2 tablespoons Dijon mustard</li>

                <li>1 teaspoon Sriracha sauce, or to taste</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Steps for cooking</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line a baking dish with lightly greased foil. </li>
                    <br>
                <li>Place carrot, celery, onion, bell pepper, mushrooms, and garlic in a food processor; pulse until 
                    very finely chopped, almost to a puree. Transfer to a<br> large mixing bowl. </li>
                    <br>
                <li>Add ground chuck to the vegetables, along with Worcestershire sauce, egg, Italian herbs, salt, black 
                    pepper, and cayenne. Mix gently with a wooden spoon<br> until ingredients are just combined. Sprinkle in 
                    bread crumbs and gently mix with your fingertips until just combined; don't overmix.  </li>
                    <br>
                <li>Shape the mixture into a loaf, about 4 inches high by 6 inches across. Place in the prepared baking pan. </li>
                    <br>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven just until the meatloaf is hot, about 15 minutes. </li>
                    <br>
                <li>Meanwhile, stir brown sugar, ketchup, Dijon, and Sriracha for glaze in a small bowl until brown sugar 
                    has dissolved. </li>
                    <br>
                <li>Remove meatloaf from the oven. Spoon glaze on the top of the meatloaf with the back of a spoon, then 
                    pull a tiny bit glaze down the sides. </li>
                    <br>
                <li>Return to the oven, and bake until no longer pink inside, 45 to 75 more minutes. An instant-read 
                    thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the<br> loaf should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C), 
                    so start checking at 45 minutes and continue baking until meatloaf reaches that temperature. </li>
                    <br>
                <li>Cooking time will depend on shape and thickness of the meatloaf. </li>
            </ol>
